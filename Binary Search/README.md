Title: Binary Search Program in Python

Description:
This program performs a binary search on a list of integers entered by the user. Binary search is an efficient searching technique that works only on sorted lists. It repeatedly divides the search interval into two halves until the target element is found or the search space becomes empty.

How the program works:

The user enters the length of the list.

The user enters each element of the list one by one.

The program prints the list as entered.

The user enters the target element to search for.

The binary search algorithm starts by setting the start index to 0 and the end index to length minus 1.

The middle index is calculated and compared with the target element.

If the target matches the middle element, its position is printed.

If the target is greater, the search continues in the right half.

If the target is smaller, the search continues in the left half.

If the element is not found, a message is displayed saying "Element not found".

Important Note:
Binary search works correctly only if the list is sorted. If the user enters an unsorted list, the search result may not be accurate.

Usage:
Run the program and follow the input prompts to enter the list elements and the target value you want to search for.
